[getonepass.eu](https://getonepass.eu/) & all its subdomains

To provide smooth and secure operation of the OnePass, we use cookie support technology.

We use cookies for different purposes: some cookies are essential for you to use our site, others let us help you speed up tasks, and others help us improve our site or protect your data.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, mobile app or use an online platform.

Cookies are widely used by online service providers to facilitate and help to make the interaction between users and websites, mobile apps and online platforms faster and easier in addition, providing reporting information.

Cookies set by the website and/or mobile app and/or platform owner (in this case, FundingBox) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website and/or mobile app and/or platform owner are called “third-party cookies”.

Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website and/or mobile app and/or platform (e.g. like analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer or device both when it visits the website and/or mobile app and/or platform in question and also when it visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps and/or platforms.

## Why we use cookies

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for OnePass to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies.

Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our Users to enhance the experience on OnePass.

Third-parties serve cookies through the OnePass for analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

## What we use cookies for

* **Essential cookies** are used for the purpose and to the extent necessary for the proper display of our websites.

## How to control and delete cookies

Most browsers offer the option of accepting or rejecting all cookies. You can easily change the cookies settings in the browser’s settings section. Please take into account that blocking all cookies may cause difficulties in operation or completely prevent the use of some of OnePass functionalities.

Managing and deleting cookies varies depending on the browser used. Detailed information on this subject can be obtained by using the “Help function” in the browser or by visiting the website [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org) which explains how to control and delete cookies step by step in most browsers.

### Personal data vs. cookie mechanism

Information obtained through the cookie mechanism and operational data may constitute personal data within the meaning of GDPR in certain exceptional situations (for example IP address).

Such personal data are processed only to the extent that is necessary for the correct display of the page and provision of the Services.

Basis for processing of data collected through “Essential” cookies and operational data is the so-called legitimate interest of the Service administrator (Article. 6.1. (f) of GDPR). To this end, the following may occur:

* **occasional analysis of log files to determine: which browsers are used by site visitors, which bookmarks, pages or subpages are most or least frequently visited or viewed, whether the page structure has errors;**
* prevention of unauthorised access to the website and distribution of malicious codes, interruption of denial of service attacks, as well as prevention of damage to computer systems and electronic communication systems.

You have the right to object to such processing.

However, if you agree to the use of “optional” cookies (e.g. provided by Google Analytics), the basis for data processing is your consent (Article 6.1 (a) of GDPR and Polish telecommunication regulations). You can withdraw your consent and delete cookies at any time (by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above). Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Obtained data will be deleted or anonymised no later than the expiry of the limitation period for potential claims related to the use of OnePass (no later than within 1 year from the date of record), or sooner if you object effectively or withdraw consent.
